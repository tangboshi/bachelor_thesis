\subsection{Device Parameters}

Remote PC IP-address: 134.130.223.151 \\
USRPs: 10.0.0.8, 10.0.0.10

\subsection{Measurement Plan}

For CW 25 the following measurement parameters were commissioned:

\begin{itemize}
	\item 2 sets of 5 measurements each with a duration of 5 minutes.
	\item SIFS: 1ms / 3ms 
	\item DIFS: 5ms  / 15ms 
	\item Backoff slot: 2s / 6ms
	\item The results should be plotted with either Matlab or Matplotlib
	\item \textbf{Update:}  Matplotlib was chosen, because it allows easy and performant integration in the automatic measurement script (python script).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Thesis scenarios should be subject of the next meeting.}

\bigskip

\textbf{Note:} The DIFS time in 802.11 can be calculated as twice the backoff time plus one SIFS time.

\section{Good to Know...}

\subsection{Bash}

\subsubsection{Efficient Remote Control}

\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{bash}
##Opening a remote connection with X forwarding
#Using -X instead of -Y adds security check, but reduces performance
#Use -C to get it more stable (gzip-compression)
#Optional -c aes128-ctr: for AES 128 encryption
#Optional -4: forces the usage of IPv4 addresses
ssh -YC4c aes-128ctr inets@134.130.223.135

##In a second terminal mount file system to local folder
#This has the advantage of the ability to treat files as though they were local
mkdir -p mnt/134.130.223.135
cd mnt/134.130.223.135

#Tip: in the next line for the last argument type . and then expand with Tab :)
#If it is necessary sshfs also allows user-mapping if file ownership is an issue
sshfs inets@134.130.223.135:/home/inets /home/alex/mnt/134.130.223.135/

#Then edit all you like as though the mounted partition was local
cd source/gr-inets/lib
atom *some_file*

\end{minted}

To further avoid any repetitive commands I added to my \href{http://alexander-pastor.de/convenient-linux-game-launcher/}{launcher tool}:

\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{bash}
"inets")
	if ( mount | grep inets  )
	then
		echo "The mount point is in use, confirm unmount with your password."
		sudo umount /home/alex/mnt/134.130.223.151
	fi
	echo "Please enter the server password to mount the target directory."
	sshfs inets@134.130.223.151:/home/inets /home/alex/mnt/134.130.223.151
	gnome-terminal --tab -e "bash -c 'ssh -YC4 inets@134.130.223.151'" \
	--tab --working-directory=/home/alex/0_ba/git/measurements \
	#--tab --working-directory=/home/alex/mnt/134.130.223.151 \
	texstudio
	sleep 1
	cd ~/0_ba/git
	git pull
	git fetch
	atom ~/0_ba/git/measurements/measurement.sh
	;;
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{Listing Directories Only}

\href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14352290/listing-only-directories-using-ls-in-bash-an-examination}{Stackoverflow Source}

\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{bash}
##Possibility 1 (fastest):
echo */
#List all subsubfolders as well:
echo */*/

##Possibility 2 (straightforward ls):
ls -d */

##Possibility 3
#where ^ means beginning of a line
ls -l | grep "^d"

##Possibility 4
#If you need to list and process all directories in a bash-script (slow)
for i in $(ls -d */); do echo ${i%%/}; done
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{Redirecting GRC Stuff to Files}
If one wants to do heavy analysis, built-in Linux console tools including, but not limited to utilities such as \verb|awk|, \verb|grep|, \verb|sed|, \verb|cat| might be a great help.

Since executing a GRC flowgraph is running a generated python script, we can achieve our goal easily by the simple means of:

\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{bash}
## Just as a concept
#These could be some lines in my alohaTestSuite.sh
mkdir -p logs
time python2 theoretical_aloha_rx.py &> logs/theoretical_aloha_rx.log
time python2 theoretical_aloha.py &> logs/theoretical_aloha.log
\end{minted}

\subsection{Python}

\subsubsection{*args and **kwargs}

\texttt{*args} can be used to pass an arbitrary amount of non-keyword arguments to a function like this:

\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{python}
	def my_func(*args):
		for index, value in enumerate(args):
			print( "{0}: {1}".format(index,value) )
	
	# let's call the function
	>>> my_func("this", "is", "an", "example")
	
	# output
 	0: this
 	1: is
 	2: an
 	3: example
\end{minted} 

\texttt{**kwargs} can be used to pass an arbitrary amount of keyword arguments to a function as follows below. Note that \texttt{**} is also used to convert dictionaries to the format specified used by \texttt{kwargs}, which is \mintinline{python}{keyword = value, keyword2 = value}.

\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{python}
	def my_func(**kwargs):
		for name, value in kwargs.items():
			print( "{0} = {1}".format(name,value) )
	
	# let's cal this function
	>>> my_dict = { "fruits": ["apple","banana"], "vegetables": ["tomato", "cucumber"]}
	>>> my_func(**my_dict)
	
	# equivalent would be:
	>>> my_func(fruits=["apple","banana"], vegetables=["tomato","cucumber"])
	
	# output
	fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
	vegetables = ["tomato", "cucumber"]
\end{minted} 

\textbf{Note:} \texttt{*args} and \texttt{**kwargs} are conventional, thus strongly recommended, but the real syntax just is \texttt{*varname} and \texttt{**varname}.

\subsubsection{List Comprehension}

List Comprehension is a powerful language feature of Python. It offers an elegant way to create lists with an easy syntax.

\bigskip

The examples below are taken from \href{http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/list_comprehensions.hawk}{here}.

\bigskip

\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{python}
	# Calculate powers of two
	powers = [2**x for x in range(10)]
	# Calculate cubic numbers
	cubes = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
	# Extract even numbers from cubes
	even = [x for x in cubes if x%2 == 0]
\end{minted}

We can also create lists of lists with list comprehension. One can also nest list comprehensions. However, for readability's sake one should not exaggerate the nesting.

\begin{minted}{python}
	words = "This is an example sentence with fancy words".split()
	cool_list = [[word.upper(), word.lower(), len(word)] for word in words]
	
	for item in cool_list:
		print(item)
	
	# would create the following output:
	["THIS", "this", 4]
	["IS", "is", 2]
	["AN", "an", 2]
	["EXAMPLE", "example", 7]
	["SENTENCE", "sentence", 8]
	["WITH", "with", 4]
	["FANCY", "fancy", 5]
	["WORDS", "words", 5]
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{map and zip}

The section summarizes \href{https://bradmontgomery.net/blog/pythons-zip-map-and-lambda/}{this source}.

\bigskip

\texttt{zip(*args)} takes equal length iterables and merges them into an iterable of tuples.

\bigskip

\texttt{map(function, iterable)} applies function to each element of iterable. It conducts the mathematical operation of mapping x to f(x). 

\subsection{Other}

\subsubsection{Atom: Folder-Wide Search for Substrings}
Use the Ctrl+Shift+F shocut and all "project folders" will be searched. To add multiple folders use the Ctrl+Shift+A shortcut.

\subsubsection{Using a static IP address for USRPs}
\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{bash}
#Get to know your interface names
ifconfig 
#E.g. set eth0 interface IP to 10.0.0.100/24
#Where up opens the eth0 interface 
#and is not necessary if it showed up when using infconfig
ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up

###Just FYI:
#Shutdown network interface
ifconfig eth0 down
##List all interfaces
ifconfig -a
#OR
ip link show
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{Git Personal Access Tokens}
Git access tokens are OAuth2 tokens that you can use instead of your password to perform any github operation. Furthermore, it also is possibly to restrict the permitted operations of a token on the github settings page. Let me walk you through the whole process:

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Go to \href{https://github.com/settings/tokens}{https://github.com/settings/tokens}
	\item Create your personal access token with the desired permissions.
	\item E.g. use your token like this: \mint{bash}{git push https://username:token@github.com/username/project.git}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note:} Don't include in any source code you upload to github. It will scan your code for tokens and immediately revoke any active token they find in your code.

\subsubsection{Latex input and include}

\href{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/246/when-should-i-use-input-vs-include}{Here's the source}.

\begin{quotation}
	\texttt{\textbackslash input\{filename\}} imports the commands from filename.tex into the target file; it's equivalent to typing all the commands from filename.tex right into the current file where the \texttt{\textbackslash input} line is.
	
	\bigskip
	
	\texttt{\textbackslash include\{filename\}} essentially does a \texttt{\textbackslash clearpage} before and after \texttt{\textbackslash input\{filename\}}, together with some magic to switch to another .aux file, and omits the inclusion at all if you have an \texttt{\textbackslash includeonly} without the filename in the argument. This is primarily useful when you have a big project on a slow computer; changing one of the include targets won't force you to regenerate the outputs of all the rest.
	
	\bigskip
	
	\texttt{\textbackslash include\{filename\}} gets you the speed bonus, but it also can't be nested, can't appear in the preamble, and forces page breaks around the included text.
\end{quotation}
