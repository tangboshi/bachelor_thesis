\section{USRP Hardware Problems} 

\subsection{How It Is Supposed to Work}

The following plots show the output of a successful measurement with two USRPs using CSMA/CA, although measurement 4 is a little bit messed up as well. Note that wrong x-axis on the line chart has been fixed by the time writing this.

\bigskip

\textbf{Note:} Always take a look at the y-axis scaling. While such data representation might confuse the skimming reader it allows for higher resolution. Also note that not every plot adds more information, this also has the purpose of showcasing different plot types.

\subsection{Failure Pattern 1}

The following six figures visualize an issue I'm experiencing with the USRPs whose origin I have difficulties to track down. In seemingly random patterns the devices fail for the rest of the transmission. To make matters worse, it is not obvious whether the problem is hardware-related or software-related. Let me first explain what happens in the following plots, though.

\bigskip

In the throughput bar chart it is obvious the device failed during the measurements 2 and 20. The logs of the measurement and this suggest that this could very well be a software problem.
After 17 seconds the sender doesn't send any frames anymore (frame\_probe 850 is not reached anymore.) Once the sender fails it doesn't recover until the measurement script and the next measurement is launched, which is a reason to suspect a software failure on either my side or Gnu Radio's.
