The demand for higher wireless transmission rates and capacities is growing rapidly. As a consequence, options to more efficiently make use of the limited frequency resources are being explored. One possibility for operators is to make use of license-free frequency bands that were not originally designated for their purposes. However, due to the exemption of license fees these bands are densely populated and measures for peaceful coexistence with "indigenous" must be taken.
This thesis experimentally examines how different medium access control (MAC) protocols and their mechanisms determine the overall performance of the nodes. To this end, we use software-defined radio (SDR) devices and software (GNU Radio) to employ different MAC protocols on the devices.
