I would like to thank my thesis advisors Andra Voicu and Peng Wang for guiding me through the process of formation of this thesis. Specifically, I am grateful for Andra's detailed feedback on earlier versions empowering me to improve on the overall quality. Furthermore, I appreciate the efforts of Peng Wang, who taught me how to use his GNU Radio MAC framework and dealing with hardware and other practical problems. 
Moreover, I owe special thanks to David Offermans and Neal F. Moran for proofreading.
