% when using IEEE Xplore input, make sure to update this to match http://www.ieee.org/documents/ieeecitationref.pdf
% acronyms in titles need proper escaping
% Pages with double dashes, i.e. ``--''
% If U.S. conference, enter also state, e.g. San Francisco, CA, US
% Note that IEEE Xplore always fails at providing correct referencing for conference proceedings!
