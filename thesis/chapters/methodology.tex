\chapter{Measurement Methodology}

This chapter is dedicated to answering the questions of what was measured and how results were obtained. Firstly, the GNU Radio flowcharts are explained. Secondly, with reference to the flowcharts measurement metrics are formally defined. Subsequently follows an overview of the semi-automatic measurement script system designed to automate, therefore accelerate the process of file system management, data processing and plotting the results. Lastly, the measurement setup is discussed in the view of the necessity of data verification.
