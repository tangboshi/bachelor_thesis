\chapter{Measurement Results}

For this chapter different combinations of two links employing pure ALOHA, non-persistent CSMA and 1-persitent-CSMA-like MAC protocols were run on the same channel. In-depth analysis of different metrics and a consecutive protocol assessment are provided. 

\textbf{As a reminder:} If not specified otherwise all transmitters are backlogged. CSMA/CA throughout this thesis is not featuring the optional RTS/CTS exchange.

\section{Same Protocol Combinations}

Throughout this section both transmitters are executing identical flowgraphs. Generally, when both links use the same MAC protocol we expect to see comparable results for any over a sufficiently longer period of time, although small variations are also expected due to statistical and hardware-related effects and inaccuracies. 

\subsection{Pure ALOHA}

For two links with saturated ALOHA traffic we have zero throughput, since each and every package collides.
